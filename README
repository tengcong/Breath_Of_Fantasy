Description:

The battle will be based on turns,
each time a character attacks and the other receives the damage.
The character has energy points and power points.
These two properties are integers numbers.


For example:

if the hero(energy points: 60, power points:45) attacks a enemy(energy points: 60, power points:45)
the enemy will have the energy decreased some points.
The damage received, decreased energy points, by enemy depends on luck factor.
Luck factor is a random number from 0 to 100 that is given for each attack turn.


There is four kinds of attacks based on your luck factor:

When the luck is 0-3 then the attack is Miss -> doesnâ€™t cause any damage;
When the luck is 4-70 then the attack is Normal -> causes 1/3 of your power points in damage;
When the luck is 71-96 then the attack is Lucky -> causes 1/3 of your power points plus twenty percent of this 1/3 in damage;
When the luck is 97-100 then the attack is Critical -> causes the double of normal attack.

TODO:
start_fight should depend on next method
add loop into engine till all enemies died or hero died


DONE:
create random order for all characters
all enemies must just attack hero not other enemies
engine can handle turns
extract params from Engine#initialize
engine can initialize hero and enimies
add engine to game
character should have different power and energy points, and fix things
------------------------------------
move all thses to Character
remove Luck, it's no use any more
refactor under_attack
add luck to game
add under_attack method to enemy
refactor attack to character
character should have role: 'hero' | 'enemy'
hero can attack
we can have a hero to fight enemy
hero should be initialized with power and energy
we should have a enemy to fight with hero too
refactor hero and enemy to inherit from character
